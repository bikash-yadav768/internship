            Mundus Alter et Idem (Another World and Yet the Same) is a satirical dystopian novel written by the English
            writer and bishop Joseph Hall around 1605. In the novel, the narrator takes a voyage in the ship Fantasia
            through the southern seas, visiting the lands of Crapulia, Viraginia, Moronia, and Lavernia (populated by
            gluttons, nags, fools, and thieves, respectively). These locations feature on this map, which accompanies
            the novel.
